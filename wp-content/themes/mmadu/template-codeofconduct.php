So, for the good of everyone, we have created a set of rules which we hope will serve as guidelines for both new members and existing members.</p>

						<h5>Be Open.</h5>
						<p>Usable is an open community and we support inclusion within the community. We invite you and others from any organization irrespective of gender or race to participate in our community activities based on their interests. </p>
						<p>We expect you to interact with others with varying levels of experience; open-minded to new ideas and encourage other members of the community. Every voice matters.</p>
						<p>The community will not tolerate threats of violence, hate speech, bullying, harassment or sexually explicit content.</p>

						<h5>Be Thoughtful.</h5>
						<p>Yes, Be NICE. We are all members of the same community, our interests align and we are here to learn and become better. For us, to be nice means:
							<ul>
								<li>You are honest. We believe that you are who you say you are. So be open about your intentions and affiliations especially where they may be a conflict of interest.</li>
								<li>You are considerate. </li>
								<li>You are respectful. Disagreements and criticisms happen. Keep no malice and work to resolve conflicts that arise. We will not excuse nor tolerate poor manners or personal attacks. We aim to create a conducive community and it’s important for us that you and other members do not feel threatened or uncomfortable. </li>
								<li>You are thoughtful a.k.a "you think before you send”.</li>
								<li>You will stay on topic. We respect people’s time and we want the time spent engaging on any of our platforms to be productive. Comments that are off-topic are most times, a distraction. Staying on topic will save everyone’s time and help us all to be productive.</li>
								<li>You will not spam. You hate spam. I hate spam. We all hate spam. For clarity, messages or contents sent to any member unsolicited, irrelevant, promotional, or repetitive is SPAM and is greatly frowned at.</li>
